The NumPy library is a popular open source Python library used for scientific computing applications, and is an acronym for `"Numerical Python"`. NumPy's operations are divided into three main categories: 
    1. Fourier Transform and Shape Manipulation
    2. Mathematical and Logical Operations, and 
    3. Linear Algebra and Random Number Generation.

NumPy is an incredible library which works perfectly well for `multi-dimensional arrays` and `matrices multiplication`.

NumPy is often used along with packages like `SciPy` (Scientific Python) and `Matâˆ’plotlib` (plotting library).
